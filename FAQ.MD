# FAQ

This document answers frequently asked questions, or questions which I think may arise about this repo.  

## Why bother?  Aren't there a bunch of cool cleaner definitions over here? https://github.com/bleachbit/cleanerml

I understand (and trust) software better when I write it myself.  That extends to BleachBit cleaner rules.  In many cases, the cleaners that I'm creating handle the problems with junk files more simplistically than cleaner definitions for the same thing that are either officially part of BleachBit or offered within the `cleanerml` repo.  

The repo allows me to track my learning about this, and hopefully extend my learning to others.

## Why don't you just PR to https://github.com/bleachbit/cleanerml?  

Because, having my own repository allows me to have greater flexibility about the rules I create.  In the way that they are useful to me, I don't need to cover as many scenarios as may be demanded by the quality standards of the BleachBit team and users.  As rules within this repo are matured, the opportunity may arise to contribute to the official repo on a case-by-case basis.
