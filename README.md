# bleachbit_cleaners
This repo contains a collection of custom BleachBit cleaners I find helpful.  These are primarily used in the deletion of junk files.

The cleaners within this repository are designed for use on Windows, using the [CleanerML](https://docs.bleachbit.org/cml/cleanerml.html) specification.

## Installation

To utilize these cleaners, it is necessary to install [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org/).
After doing so, copy the `Cleaners` directory from this repository to the directory `%userprofile%\%appdata%\BleachBit` (the `Cleaners` directory should exist/be created below this level).  When BleachBit starts, it will read the cleaners from this directory.

## Usage - GUI

Using the files as provided, all will show up under the "Custom" section of Bleachbit's user interface.  Check on/off the functions as desired. 

## Usage - Command Line
